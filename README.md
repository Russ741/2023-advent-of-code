# Advent of Code 2023

(Almost) all of my solutions to the [2023 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2023) of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## Summary

Advent of Code is a series of Christmas-themed programming challenges from Dec. 1st-25th:
* At midnight (Eastern), one problem description (in narrative prose), sample input/answer, and input file are posted.
  * Input files are personalized/randomized for each contestant.
* The contestant submits the answer (usually a 64-bit or less integer) for the given problem and input.
* When the contestant submits the correct answer, the second challenge's problem description is unlocked.
  * The second challenge usually uses the same input file as the first, but the problem requires interpreting it in a more computationally intensive way.
* The contestant submits the answer (same format) for the second problem.

## Tool-Assisted Solves

In Advent of Code, the contestant only needs to come up with a solution for a single specific, known input, and they do not need to "show their work". \n
Contrast with LeetCode, etc. where the candidate must provide a self-contained piece of code with limited dependencies that produces the right answers for a test suite of opaque inputs spanning the problem space. \n
Advent of Code inputs are also sometimes structured to yield an answer more readily than the general formulation presented in the problem.
As such, it lends itself to tool-assisted (semi-automated) solves.
